## About
&nbsp;&nbsp; This project is an exercise where I develop a simple shopping cart. The idea is to fetch data from [Mercado Libre](https://mercadolibre.com/)'s API to show results from a search for the key word "computer".

&nbsp;&nbsp; The code base was created by Trybe's team. My goal was to develop the page's functionalities and the functions' unit tests based on Requirements given by Trybe.
	
## Requirements Overview:
- [x] Develop the project base on the TDD process;
- [x] Render a list of products using the endpoint `https://api.mercadolibre.com/sites/MLB/search?q=$QUERY`
- [x] Add a function to add items to the cart;
- [x] Add a function to remove items individually from the cart;
- [x] Add a function to clear the cart;
- [x] Load all saved cart items when refreshing the page;
- [x] Display cart's total price;
- [x] Add a 'loading' text when during the API's request;
- [x] Tests should have 100% coverage;

## Files:
&nbsp;&nbsp; Files developed by me:
- script.js;
- the majority of style.css (the header was styled by Trybe);

All the other files where developed by Trybe with minor adjustments.
